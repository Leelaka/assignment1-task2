Task 2 of the assignment (Uber)

sources integrated with leaflet.js, openmaps, and materialize css

Brief idea: 


Uber web application, 3 hardcoded places to try out: University, Supermarket, Park

You can search for an address using the search button in the map. 

Timer stays till 25seconds and after 15 seconds of completion the web application will reset the routes made.
